## Limitations
Pocket Code for iOS is still in development and does not ship with all the features the Android version has. Since it does not support the same *Catrobat Language Version* (the programming language *Pocket Code* is using), projects created on Android phones might not be visible on the *Catrobat community* screen on iOS. However, all projects created with *Pocket Code for iOS* will be available on *Pocket Code for Android*.
